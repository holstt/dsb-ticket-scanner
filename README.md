# DsbTicketScanner
This application scans and visualizes ticket prices from dsb.dk (the Danish train operating company).

Features include: 
- Show ticket prices for specific time intervals and destinations. A ticket contain prices for all ticket types i.e. adult, student, orange etc.
- Show ticket price development over time 
- Get notified if ticket price falls or rises


## Motivation

Getting an overview of available tickets on dsb.dk can be very cumbersome if you are flexible with the depature time/date. 
For instance, the search results only show a part of the depatures for a given day which means you have to "expand" the results multiple times, or it may even require you to make a new search in order to show earlier/later depature times. 
Furthermore, you have to make a new search to show result for another date. 

Lastly, it is useful to know how ticket prices develop over time, so you know how many days in advance you should buy your ticket to avoid paying overprice.
